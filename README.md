## :hash: What is the purpose of this repo?
Tremendous advances in the field of biotechnology enable researchers and scientists to produce and obtain a diverse and huge amount of biological data.  Therefore, there is a corresponding increase in the way of visualizing the biological data to represent information and science through art in a concise and meaningful way. 

In this respect, [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) has recently emerged and it can be used to create interactive charts and state-of-the-art graphs in a wide range of visualization applications including visualization of sequences, genomes, alignments, gene expressions. 

So, I have wanted to learn how to use this library with Python, create some great charts and shared them.

## :hash: Requirements and Installation
 - Create a directory and download all files or clone the repository via Git using the following command:
 
 	`git clone https://github.com/furkanmtorun/Plotly_BioVisualization.git`

 - Install the required packages if you do not already:
 
	` pip install -r requirements.txt `

- Then, the turn to run it: 

	`python Plotly_BioVisualization.py`

- It's ready to use now! Open your web browser and go to:

	`http://127.0.0.1:8050 `

> If you did not install **pip** yet, please follow the instruction [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

> In the development process, Python 3 has been used. The use of Python 2.x might cause compatibility issues.  

## :hash: How to create interactive graphs and charts?

- ### :hash:  Needle Plot
	- **Purpose:** It allows you to illustrate the mutations or other changes on the corresponding positions of amino acids within the protein sequence together with the protein domains.
	- **Data structure:** JSON / Dict = `{ x: [], y: [], domains: [], mutationGroups: [] }`

	- **Coding (just review the code, the comments are over there!):**

- ### :hash:  Sequence/Alignment Viewer
	- **Purpose:** It allows you to visualize the genomics and transcriptomic sequence with several features such as coverage, gaps, consensus, and heatmap overview.
	- **Data Structure:** FASTA / Clustal
			![Seq. Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49681382/74554009-951baa00-4f69-11ea-9faf-b94b481ce4e5.png)

- ### :hash:  Manhattan Plot
	- **Purpose:** Manhattan Plot is a type of scatter plot and commonly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to visualize display significant SNPs efficiently.
		> The genome-wide significance threshold was set as 5e-8 and plotted with green line, and the most significant SNPs are colored in red.
